Overnight using the timer

## First try
- 1/2 cup of oats
- 1/2 cup water (using the Porridge lines)
- porridge mode
- timer for 6:00 starting at 23:30ish

### Result
I opened the cooker to see the oats still in water.
The water was a little under the initial 0.5 mark for Porridge.
Taste-wise, pretty dang good! No oats still stiff or seeming under-cooked
