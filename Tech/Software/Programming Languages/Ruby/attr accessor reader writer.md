# attr_accessor/reader/writer
These are ways to make attributes on classes that can be accessible through the object.

The syntax is: `attr_accessor :attr-name`

Here are the differences between the three variants:
- `attr_reader` - only read values
- `attr_writer` - only write values
- `attr_accessor` - read & write values
