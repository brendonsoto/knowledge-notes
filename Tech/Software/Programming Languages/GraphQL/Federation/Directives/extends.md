#graphql #how-to #federation

Syntax: `@extends`
Example: #to-do

The `@extends` directive allows you to add fields to a type from another graph.
It requires referencing the [[Tech/Software/Programming Languages/GraphQL/Federation/Directives/key|key directive]] from the main type through the [[Tech/Software/Programming Languages/GraphQL/Federation/Directives/external|external directive]]
