- Zettlekasten style
- Each note will have a "last-viewed" column/timestamp
    - A threshold can be set so over time, if that note isn't referred to as much some indicator can be shown or added to say "this information hasn't been used in a long time"

Idk where I"m going with this.
The idea was a system that will let you know when your knowledge is going stale over time.
