I have yet to find an ELI5 explanation. It seems like cell-based architecture is the same as microservices. Most sources mention cell-based architecture is like micro-services but more granular. On the Nordic API's site [^2], they try to use adding new functionality as a means to explain the difference between the two architectures. They stated microservices (service-oriented-architecture) would address this by adding the functionality to an existing service or setting it outside of the a cluster. The cell-based approach would be to create a new cell, essentially a new service, to address this. I think that approach would be taken too with the microservices architecture, but clearly I'm dumb since I can't parse this mumbo jumbo.
