tl;dr - Kafka is a set of tools that allows you to send and receive data in real-time, store that data, and process that data as it comes.

An open-source platform for distributed event streaming that provides the abilities to:
- read/write to streams of events
    - Kafka uses the terminology *subscribe to* and *publish* for read/write
- store data/events indefinitely
- process data/events as the occur or retroactively
