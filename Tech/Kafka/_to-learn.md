- how to get Kafka talking with Nestjs
- how does confluent fit in?
- what's in zookeeper's config?
- what's in the broker config?
- Kafka Connect
    - I don't need to emit events
- testing
- Schema regsitry/management

## Nice to know, but not needed right now
- how to setup a kafka app with Scala?
- How does ZooKeeper play with Kafka?
- How do you coordinate starting/monitoring Kafka?
    - I'm guessing it's not like you spin up a server, ssh into, run ZooKeeper, repeat with another server but to run a Kafka broker, and etc.
