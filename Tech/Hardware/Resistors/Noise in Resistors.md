Types of noise that can exist in a resistor:
- **thermal**
    - temperature related
    - sounds the same as white noise
- **contact**
    - average DC current, material geometry & type, size
    - can be *improved* by using a resistor with a **higher power rating**
- **shot**
    - average DC current
    - can be *improved* by using **low current**
- **current**
    - is inverse to frequency
    - byproduct of current flowing through the resistor (the resistor also has a bit of capacitance and inductance due to its construction)
