- Use the power law to determine the **power output** of the circuit, and then **double** that
- Consider if the resistors will be close together, in an enclosure, operating under higher temperatures, etc.
- An *increase in power rating* of a resistor that's an input to an amp (or other applications, idk yet) can *decrease noise*
