## Checking components

### Resistors

Expected | Actual
------------ | --------
1M | 992k & 995k
100k | (99k4 x2) & 100k3 & 99k8 & (99k5 x2) & 99k6 & (100k x2)
68k | 67k6 & 67k4
47k | 4k676
33k | 32k86
14k | 1k392
1k5 | 1k494
1k | 1k007 & 996
10 | 10.0 & 10.0

### Thermistors
Should be 10k x4
Not sure how to accurately measure
I have them connected to the multimeter

They're hovering around:
- 9k64
- 9k3
- 9k5
- 9k51

## Notes from sections

### Oscillation Basics
> ...a sawtooth-wave's frequency is solely determined by the
duration of its second phase. The longer it takes for the
voltage to fall down, the lower the frequency of the
wave â€“ and vice versa. This makes it comparably easy
to manipulate that frequency.

This is interesting to me.
I believe a capacitor has to do with the drop in voltage and thus a key component in controlling frequency.
If so, how is the frequency of a pulse wave determined?
Or is a capacitor involved in both and a resistor is used to control the speed of the capacitor discharging?

### The Oscillator Core
I really like the analogy of a capacitor being like a balloon.

So a **Schmitt Trigger Inverter** is a doo-hickey that has two inputs: one for sensing an input voltage and another that's connected to another voltage source (like power?).
Inside the component the input voltage is checked against two thresholds, a high point and a low point.
When the input voltage changes from one of those thresholds to another the *output* of the inverter changes to either a high voltage or a low voltage (sourced from the other input!).
I'm not super sure if I got this correct...

### Building the Core
When using an IC it's favorable to *connect unused inputs to ground* in order to **prevent picking up static noise**.
Static noise may make the IC act unexpectedly.

I also like the explanation for why you can't just plug in an audio socket at this point to hear the oscillation.
Picturing the addition of the socket as another path for electricity to flow that is more of a "path of least resistance" than the capacitor and thus there's no oscillation makes sense.

### Buffering, Coupling, Listening
Buffers are like Schmitt Triggers in the sense that they both have *voltage sensors*.
A **buffer** mirrors its input voltage level using the voltage sensor input.
Since the buffer uses a voltage sensor, no current flows through it and as a result they're great for representing voltage without possibly interfering with the voltage.

I got sound!

### Changing the Frequency
A transistor can act as a kind of variable resistor.
Transistors have a quality that allows a linear change in input voltage to be reflected as an exponential change in current.
Neat!
A resistor can be connected to the base of a transistor to ensure not too much current gets to the transistor.

### Sequences, Scaling and Offsets
Voltage divider came in for scaling incoming voltages down!
The section on "shifting the center" confused me.
Oh!
I think I get it now.
I was confused on where the "constant voltage" source would be.
I see now we're using the voltage going into the transistor's base as our constant voltage.
The sequence voltage changes then are added on top of that voltage.

I did not have a sequencer by but was able to kind of mimic it using it a photo-cell resistor.
I attached the photo resistor basically where the sequencer input jack is.
I was able to vary the pitch that way.
I also did hear the change in pitch from just touching the transistors.
I also tried blowing on it to cool it down and noticed a change then too.
This is really nice to have a hands on way of exploring these concepts.

## Questions
### Why are there different types of resistors?

### Why are there different types of capacitors?

### How is it that a diode can prevent current in a direction?

### What exactly is a Schmitt Trigger Inverter?

### Why does static noise in some inputs of an IC impact other inputs/outputs/operations?
