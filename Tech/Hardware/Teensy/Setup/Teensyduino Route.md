All versions after Teensy 2.0 (LC, 3.x and beyond) support [teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html), a sort of plugin for [Arduino's IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) that allows you to load programs onto an Arduino.

Follow the instructions on the teensyduino page (the link in the previous paragraph).

I think the only bits I got myself into some trouble were:
- Step 2: Once you download the Arduino package *don't run the install script in the package*. Least not until *after* you ran the teensyduino installer
- Step 5: Doesn't exist and probably is self-explanatory but sometimes I need things spelled out for me: *Now* run the Arduino install script
