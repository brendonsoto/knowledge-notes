There are instructions from the [docs](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/first_use.html), however they're a little bit disorganized.
There's helpful information on it, but it is a bit difficult to follow.
I'll have a separate section below for the helpful parts.
First, here's my stab at a simplified overview:

## First: Confirm the blink program runs
This is simple.
Just plug the Teensy into a USB port.
You should see a LED alternate between on and off (hence "blink") every second.
If you see that, :thumbsup:.
If you don't, :shrug: (Sorry, I know that's not helpful but I believe every board is tested before shipped).

## Install software to load programs onto Teensy
Here's where I felt the process was a bit disorganized.
There are various Teensy boards out there at the time of writing (4.1 is the latest).

Check out either:
- [[Tech/Hardware/Teensy/Setup/Teensyduino Route|Teensyduino Route]]
- [[Tech/Hardware/Teensy/Setup/CLI Route|CLI Route]]
