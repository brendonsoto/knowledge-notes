The RGB LED I have works opposite of the LED mentioned in the tutorial.
Instead of power being supplied to the colored pins, it's supplied to only one pin.
I'm not super sure how it works.
I played around with different resistance values but don't feel like I have an intuitive sense.
I also forgot how to read resistor values and figured this could be a fun opportunity to mess around to try to find out how this LED works and revisit the relationship between voltage and resistance (Ohm's law I guess?).

One caveat: I currently do not have a *multi-meter*.
Sooooo I cannot actually measure stuff.
As a result, I'm going to use math to guestimate the values.
(I say guestimate because the tolerance of the resistors implies the resistors actual value varies).

First, I took a moment to revisit [[Tech/Hardware/Electronics - General/How to read resistor values]].

Next: Ohm's law.
