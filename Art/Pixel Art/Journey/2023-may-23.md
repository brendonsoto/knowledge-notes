Today I watched the first half of [Alvin Roe's Beginner Pixel Art Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_EKrg2fIuc). Even though I think he mentioned four tips only two really stood out to me:
- shapes & consistent patterns
- color theory

I think these two were what he considered the basic techniques to focus on.

## Shapes and consistent patterns
I went down a lil rabbit hole here regarding circles. I think it's interesting analyzing how circles are made with pixel art. It sounds dumb at first, but think about how circles at different sizes would look. What's the smallest circle look like?

This is hard to see but the first thing in the image is a 2x2 square. That's definitely not a circle. The image to the right of it is me trying to "open up" the circle to achieve more of a circle. It doesn't really work. The image to the right of it zoomed out works, but that's a solid dot.

Here's an image of me playing around with circles in the editor (to avoid needing to blow up the image):

It's a bit all over the place. The thing I found interesting was thinking how to emulate curves. I personally think the bottom left and top right are the most circular pixel-circles out of the bunch. The "pattern" followed there was to maintain N number of pixels in a line. Here's kinda a process in a picture:

In a weird way, my brain finds it easier thinking of it in terms of lines/vectors. Specifically vectors. Each vector has to have the same magnitude and where one vector ends another begins. Here, we're starting off with a diagonal of 3 pixels. Then we reach the "top" of the circle. We already have our starting pixel so only 2 more are needed. Same with the downward descent and so on.

Compare this method of creating a circle and its result with the circle above that has 3 pixels in its diagonals, but 2 in its cardinals (top/left/right...). That one looks boxier, least to me. The "circle" that is basically only diagonals doesn't look like a circle at all, but a diamond or rotated square.

It's also interesting seeing how the different zoom levels can impact perceiving shade within a "circle" (I suck at screen recordings at the moment):

Oh yeah I probably should've mentioned this before I'm using [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

Double oh! I also learned about [Lospec](https://lospec.com/)!
