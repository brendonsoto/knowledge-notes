Documenting my journey learning pixel art!

I'm _very_ new to this.
I suck at drawing period.
I was ok at it as a kid, but that was from me staring at my action figures intensely as references while attempting to copy over the image to paper.
I want to pick up pixel art because I do want to get into making visual art again and the technicality of pixel art intrigues me.
Part of me feels pixel art makes more sense to my brain, but that might just be the engineering side speaking :P.

The files here will be by date.
