Today I watched [this video on going from Noob to Pro in Pixel Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I_OZ4qQJfY&list=WL&index=4). I liked the point about thinking about the shapes of objects in real life and how they may be represented in pixels. I also really appreciated the note on how pixel art isn't necessarily to be exact, but to convey an idea. In a sense, it reminds me of the blandness of most protagonists and how that's intentional so viewers can insert parts of themselves into the character (cough cough, harry potter).

I was motivated to try creating something in Krita! Something near me: a clock! This turned out more tricky and interesting than I thought.

Clocks are pretty simple right? It's a circle with two lines, one slightly longer than the other. How do you make a circle when you have a grid that uses an even number of boxes? Even if you were to use an odd number of pixels within that grid that would just be awkward in a setting with other objects, wouldn't it?

Here are two clocks I made.

It's a bit hard to see but the first one is 1px wider than the other. Both were made using a 16x16 grid. I started off with the arrows because I was unsure how I'd want the outline to look. I decided to make the long hand 1px longer than the short hand. From there, I created a rule to have at least 1px of space between the long hand and the border of the clock. I counted 3 pixels out from the "center" point, where the long and short hands originate from, counted 1 pixel for space, and then marked off my edge. I did this in the cardinal directions (up/down/left/right).

At this point I thought there was too much space on the right side of the clock compared to the left. I decided to tighten up the right side by a pixel. This meant basically shortening the width of the clock by a pixel. The result has an even width and length. It looks simultaneously neater but also like there needs to be more room on the right hand side.

Overall, I think both get the point across! I'm going to guess the latter, the one with the shorter side and equal dimensions, would fit most contexts better since the equal dimensions would mean the clock would fit in with other even grids more cohesively.

I wonder how the two approaches would differ for times that involve a diagonal. Or if there's another clock style!
