In no particular order, a list of things I'd like to learn about:
- the importance of different brushes. why to use one over another in a certain context? how to identify which would be best for a certain result?
- how to draw:
    - hair
    - faces
    - eyes
    - armor
    - people
    - boots / shoes / feet (I hate drawing feet!!!!)
    - dragons
