I want to learn how to draw better!

I know that sounds ridiculous. I have images in my head that I want to realize, but I feel I don't have the skills to do so. Part of it is related to [pixel art](Art/Pixel%20Art/index.md) ideas I have for games. Another part is for non-pixel art for games. And also, I find it kind of therapeutic to draw out how I feel. It feels kind of easier to get into than music sometimes. There are times where it doesn't capture the same message, but I think that's because I'm more capable on a guitar right now than I am with pen and paper. I'm on a tangent! Back to the main event!

Now, I have _no_ idea how to start or go about with _any_ of this! So I figured this could be a great opportunity to try documenting my process for others who may be in a similar boat!

Background: I'm... I don't know how to describe myself. I like music. I like programming. I like video games. I program for a living (web development) and went to school for music. I've been told I'm very analytical. I'm also a softie.

I tried watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RmGV5wALG0) but felt I ended with more questions than answers. I came out of that video thinking:
- need a balance of doing things for passion/fun and technique
- youtube is a great resource
- there are also paid resources (like that proko one for figure drawing)
- on the technique side, identify something you're bad at and look up how others do it

Cool! Problem is, I don't know what any techniques are called! I'm not even sure if there's a general process to follow! Granted, it's art so do whatever, but my brain needs some sort of internal plan. I can draw what comes to mind, but I don't know how to identify what to improve on. For instance, I'm going to draw a knight with an axe real quick.

Why a knight? 'Cause I like knights and dragons and magic and stuff! Why do I sound like a kid in my language now? 'Cause fuck being an adult! (I'm convinced no one actually is an adult. It's just a myth.)

Anyways, there's a lot to be desired in this drawing. How can I break it down into different areas to improve on?

Aside: I just learned "anyways" is a word! And "anywho" isn't! I usually say "anywho" to transition and some people have made fun of me for it. I didn't think it was weird but apparently not only is it weird but it's also just not a thing. Womp womp.

In no particular order:
- hair
- faces
- eyes
- body proportions
- armor / clothing
- feet
- objects

That's pretty general. Plus, these things are usually seen together so drawing one without the other may seem a little weird.

I think poses is where I want to start. Or figures? I'm not sure what to call it. How can I draw a person in various poses? I feel like I can start with an abstraction and work my way there.

Cause I'm flippin terrible at keeping up with things, I'm going to look for a video to use for next time.
