## What is a fever?
According to [John Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/fever), a fever is "a body temperature that is higher than normal. It usually means there is an abnormal process occurring in the body."

## What happens when you have a fever?
Fever is a part of the [Acute Phase Response](Health/Acute%20Phase%20Response.md). More specifically, fever is process of raising the body's temperature. This happens "due to the upward resetting of the hypothalamic thermostat". (Is the hypothalamic thermostat like the body's internal thermometer? What is the difference between thermometer and thermostat?)
