# Disease, Illness, and Sickness

## Background context
When I got covid I developed a pretty bad fever. As I was getting out of it I became curious about what exactly is a fever and what goes on in the body during it. As I was reading different papers on [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) I realized all of the papers I read were using the term "disease" and never the term "illness", which is what I often use when I'm feeling unwell. I felt this was weird considering I've had fevers before and always associated them with illnesses, not necessarily diseases. This weirdness made me think maybe I didn't really know what "disease" and "illness" mean nor the difference between them.

I always thought an illness was something temporary while a disease was a longer lasting, maybe even lifelong, problem. I started off my search with a simple "what is the difference between disease and illness" and found [this article from 1977](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/756356/). I love the sass:

> The dysfunctional consequences of the Cartesian dichotomy have been enhanced by the power of biomedical technology. Technical virtuosity reifies the mechanical model and widens the gap between what patients seek and doctors provide. Patients suffer "illnesses"; doctors diagnose and treat "diseases".

Afterwards, I searched "what is a disease" and "what is an illness". I found [another gem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900376/):

> Ordinary people use the term correctly, as they have for at least half a millennium. Illness is the comfortable, familiar and meaningful word used to denote unwellness in general: someone has fallen ill; another has died of a chronic illness.
>
> How did this etymologic thievery come about in our medical schools? Credit is generally given in the literature to Irwin Kleinman.1 In a parenthetical statement, he writes that illness is “the human experience of sickness.” In a later book, he states, “By invoking the term illness, I mean to conjure up the innately human experience of symptoms and suffering.”2 This merely declarative appropriation is astonishing and naive. Can our profession be so weak-kneed as to yield a central term in our everyday practice simply because one of us says it should be so? What is the truth about the term illness?

I love "etymologic thievery".
