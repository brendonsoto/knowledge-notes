## What is inflammation?
Inflammation is used to describe the body's response to injury, disease, and illness.

There's no concrete definition. From [Inflammation-Nature's Way to Efficiently Respond to All Types of Challenges: Implications for Understanding and Managing "the Epidemic" of Chronic Diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30538987/):

> ...the typical physiological response is: an increase in blood supply to the area, an increase in white cells into the affected tissue, an increase in phagocytic activity to remove the offending agent, followed by a down-regulation of these mechanisms resulting in healing. The cascade of inflammation is the body's unique mechanism to maintain its integrity in response to macroscopic as well as microscopic injuries.
