## Food Sources of Dopamine


From [healthshots.com](https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/superfoods/these-7-dopamine-boosting-foods-will-make-you-feel-happy-and-energized/):
- nuts and seeds (specifically, almonds, walnuts, and flax seeds)
    - These foods are abundant in tyrosine, an amino acid that breaks down to produce dopamine.
- meat/eggs/fish (non-vegetarian)
    - Food items that have a lot of protein often have a lot of tyrosine as well.
- soy, legumes, beans
- milk & dairy
- chocolate
    - Produces serotonin and has phenylethylamine, a compound that can stimulate the production of dopamine (need to find study from Georgia Health Sciences University on this)
- coffee
