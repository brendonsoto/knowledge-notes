# How to Clear a Parameter Lock
Unfortunately you cannot "undo" a parameter lock unless if it's for an effect (see FX)
You have to reset the step by basically toggling it off and back on.
Let's go through an example; consider we have locks on step 4 and want to clear it.
- press **write**
- press 4
  - at this point the LED should toggle from lit to not-lit
- press 4
  - the LED should be lit again
  
## Clearing FX
- press **write**
- hold 16 to clear for whatever steps you want to clear
