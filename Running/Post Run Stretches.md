15 seconds for each
hold for 30 seconds for problematic ones

- Don't just stop, walk or slow-run for a bit
    - helps remove chemicals that will keep tense
- Drink water

Hip Flexor stretches
- lunge
- lower back leg, but don't touch floor
- touch floor with knee, lounge forward, lift same asrm up
- rotate lower part of back leg (shin and below) 45 degress and lean forward more

Groin
- kind of like child's pose but with legs apart too, like a V where they connect at the heels
- sit up while in the position

Quads and Feet
- from the same pose, lean back, sit onto your feels, it's like you're making a 90 degree right angle triangle

Glutes
- pigeon pose
- next is similar, but the leg under you is kind of horizontal and you kind of grab your foot or lean into it so you can stretch the outer side of that leg

Hamstrings
- Have legs apart, like an u pside down V (wider than shoulder-width apart), and reach for foot on one side with both hands,  outsidce of the ankle, don't round back
- same thing but feet shoulder-width apart
- same thing, but feet together, and bend the leg you're stretching away from

Calf
- Lunge near wall but with back leg
- Same, but bend the back leg a bit

Lumbar support
- Lie on floor, bring one knee up, hold it, keep core tight
