Overnight using the timer

## Try 1
- 1/2 cup of oats
- 1/2 cup water (using the Porridge lines)
- porridge mode
- timer for 6:00 starting at 23:30ish

### Result
I opened the cooker to see the oats still in water.
The water was a little under the initial 0.5 mark for Porridge.
Taste-wise, pretty dang good! No oats still stiff or seeming under-cooked

## Try 2
- 1/2 cup of oats
- water at 1-1/2at the *white* setting
  - just hitting the bottom of the 0.5 text of the *porridge* setting
- porridge mode
- timer for 8:20 starting around 23:30ish

### Result
The oats are still very watery.
The water line did go down a bit, about 1/4th of the white markers.

Taste was good!

## Try 3
Same as others but with water at 1-1/4ish using the white markers (the 1 was not visible )

### Result
Oats were still under water a bit.
The reduction in the water line looks the same as before: about 1/4

## Try 4
- 1/2 cup of oats
- water at 1 the *white* setting
- porridge mode
- timer for 7:00 starting around 23:49

### Result
Oats still under water
Line did not move much
However, barely any water came out when i tried straining.
Perhaps this is the ticket!

## Try 5
Trying based off of the packaging which suggests a 3:1 ratio of water to oats.
Still porridge setting and a timer for 07:00 starting at 23:53.

### Result
The water wasnt completely over the oats!

At the same time, the oats don't look as fluffy as previous times.
Taste was good too!
