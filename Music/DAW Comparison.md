Studio One was neat but seemed unintuitive in basic sections, like how to set up my Monologue as both a sound and keyboard input.

Bitwig annoys me in how its MIDI automation/capture always starts you from zero.
You can get around this by entering the clip and double clicking some dots near the beginning but the extra step is annoying.
What I'm trying to do is to make two tracks per hardware instrument.
One is a MIDI track for capturing just notes.
The other is an audio track to record the notes plus any automation.
That way I can have multiple clips tied to a single MIDI note clip representing different parameter tweaks.
