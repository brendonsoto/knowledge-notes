I need a plan to get back into making music on a computer
I have the Atom pad controller

## Brain Dump

For a workflow, I want to know how to:
- set up a mono audio track quickly
- set up a track that can send MIDI to an external instrument but record it's audio back (I think it's called an Aux channel in Studio One?)
- set up a track for a digital instrument
- quickly-ish make a drum rack by recording sounds from my synths and putting them in impact
- how to scrub forward in time
- how to zoom in
- how to arm a track
- how to disarm a track
- how to use the pad to enter in notes for drums
- how to make a template to use the Console 1 SSL plugins on everything
- how to change the bpm
- how to change time signature (globally)
- how to set up a session for multiple time signatures (e.g. 4 bars of 4/4 followed by 4 of 3/4)
