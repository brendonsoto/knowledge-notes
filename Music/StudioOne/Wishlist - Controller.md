Things I wish I could do from a controller:
- add instrument track
- add audio track
- add bus track for selected audio track
- navigate time line w/ scroll
- track volume control (but not non-motorized fader)
    - maybe non-motorized would be better for me? force me to be quick
- insert events to trigger
