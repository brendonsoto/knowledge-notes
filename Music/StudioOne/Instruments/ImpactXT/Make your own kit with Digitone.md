#how-to

This is in kind of 3 parts:

## Digitone side
- Create a sound pool
- Press the Record button `o` (looks like a circle)
- For N sounds you want to use in the pad, starting w/ key pad 1:
    - Press and hold the key pad
    - Rotate the *Level/Data* (has *Sound Browser* underneath it) to select the sound you want
    - Repeat the above two steps with the next key
- Select *Fill/Scale* (`FUNC + PAGE`)
- Rotate the `F` knob until the *Scale* value reads `1/8`

## Studio One Side

1. Set up a track w/ Digitone
2. Create a Bus track
3. Route the *Digitone output* to the *Bus input*
4. Create an Audio track
5. Route the *Bus output* to the *Audio input*
- Click the `Record` button (at the bottom)
- Stop the recording once all of your sounds have played
- Right click on the audio event
- Click *Strip silence*
- Right click on the audio event again (can be any of the resulting bits)
- Click `Audio > Send To new impact`
- voila
