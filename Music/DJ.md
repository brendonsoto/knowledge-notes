## Organizing Music

Specific to Rekordbox but sure can be applied to other programs
- Use the *genre* metadata to apply the most broad label (e.g. techno instead of techno - peak time)
- Use *tags* metadata to apply any subgenres the track fits into
- Use *rating* metadata to apply the energy level of the track
- Add something like a "poop" tag to add to any songs in your library that either doesn't get played that often or doesn't fit vibes of events so you can remove them over time
