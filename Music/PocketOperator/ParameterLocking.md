# How to do Parameter Locking
For what parameter locking means see here: [[Music/PocketOperator/_Definitions#Parameter Locking]]

*Note: This can be done while playing a pattern too.*

- press **write**
- hold down the step (1-16) you want to set parameters for
- rotate the knobs to set whatever the knobs are mapped to to the step
  - *Note: While a pattern is playing **knob A** controls the volume of the currently selected sound*

## Set FX for steps
- press **play**
- hold **fx** and press 1-16 to apply a fx to a step

## Set Glide for steps
- press **write**
- to **set glide up** on a note, hold a lit step *and* press **glide**
- to **set glide down** on a note, hold an *unlit* step *and* press **glide**
  - the previous note *does not* need to have a glide up step enabled

## Notes
- Cannot parameter lock vibrato stuff
