# How to Live Record
The title is a little misleading.
It's not the type of live recording you're thinking of.
The type where you press a button, play a sequence of notes, and they're all recorded.
Well, it kind of is, but a bit jankier.
You're basically punching-in notes that are quantized to a certain step.

- while *not in write mode*, hold the **write** button
- press whatever notes you want
