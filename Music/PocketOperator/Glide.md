# Glide
Glide is used to describe a transition in pitch to or from a note, like sliding up a guitar string to or from a note.

*Note:* The time to glide up to a note is quicker than gliding down

## Glide up to a note
- *Hold* the **glide** button
- press 1-16 / a note

## Glide down from a note
Same as [[Music/PocketOperator/Glide#Glide up to a note|Glide up to a note]] but w/ one more step:
- release 1-16 / a note *while* holding the **glide** button

It's like a chromatic down effect!
