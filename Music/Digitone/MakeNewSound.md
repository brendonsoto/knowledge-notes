# How to Make a New Sound

If following the notes from [[Music/Digitone/MakeNewSound]] you'll be on a brand new patch once at the sound design screen.
It's the screen with the BPM in the right corner, FM algo, and tuning info.

Let's say you're on an empty patch (titled "UNTITLED") and have made some changes

- hit the gear btn
- select "SOUNDS"
- select "SOUND MANAGER"
- find an empty slot
    - name is usually just multiple of the symbol \/
- press the right key
- select "EXPORT TO HERE"
- enter your patch's name
- select any tags for the sound
