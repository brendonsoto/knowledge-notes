Huuuuge Kudos to https://www.elektronauts.com/t/digitone-tips-and-tricks/98711

- Set up your sound pool
- Press `Gear` button
- Scroll down to *Control*
- Press `Yes`
- Use `<` and `>` buttons to select which multi map layout you want to use
- Press `Yes`
- Scroll to `--- Add range ---`
- Press `Yes`
- Use the `E` knob to scroll to the note you want to map the sound to
    - **NOTE:** If using the Digitone (w/o keys) you can only use the range C0-C1
- Use the `F` knob to decrease the *Span* to 1
- Make sure *INT* (below the *Start/Span/Ranges* numbers) is highlighted
- Press `Yes`
- The new range should be highlighted on the screen
- Press `Yes`
- Use the `v` (down arrow button) to scroll down to *SOUND SLOT*
- Use the `E` knob to select the index of the sound in the sound pool you want
- Use the `^` (up arrow button) to scroll up to *NOTE*
- Use the `E` knob to select the pitch of the sound you want
- Press `No` to return to the ranges

All set! You should be able to play now!
You can even **record** while on this screen!
The Digitone will map the notes to the correct sound pools so you can exit the multi map edit screen and still hear the results.

**IMPORTANT:** You **have** to be on the multi map edit screen to use the feature.
