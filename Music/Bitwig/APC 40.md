By default, the APC 40's grid will be used as a MIDI controller to transmit notes.

## How to...
### Switch modes
- Press and hold **Shift**
- Look for the column of buttons under **Scene Launch** (to the right of the Clip Launch grid)
- For _Session_ mode press the **first** pad
- For _Note_ mode press the **first** pad
- For _Drum_ mode press the **first** pad
- For _Sequencer_ mode press the **first** pad
- For _Raindrops_ mode press the **first** pad

## Modes

The different modes impact what the **Clip Launch/Session Overview** grid of pads/buttons do.

### Session

This is to launch clips.
The pads under will trigger the pads in Bitwig to play.

### Note

This mode turns the grid into a midi-controller.
*Note:* The layout is kind of weird.

The pads under **Scene Launch** change the scale used in the grid.
The top two pads configure the pads into Minor and Major scales.
The third/middle pad can configure the grid into a chromatic scale or to use the key.
You can toggle the two by pressing the third pad again.
It will toggle between the two states.

While *In Key*, you can ascend the scale using the first three columns.
While in *Chromatic*, you can ascend the scale/sequence using the first five columns.
It's a bit weird.
