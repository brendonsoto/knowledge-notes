The different modes impact what the **Clip Launch/Session Overview** grid of pads/buttons do.

## Session

This is to launch clips.
The pads under will trigger the pads in Bitwig to play.

## Note

This mode turns the grid into a midi-controller.
*Note:* The layout is kind of weird.

The pads under **Scene Launch** change the scale used in the grid.
The top two pads configure the pads into Minor and Major scales.
The third/middle pad can configure the grid into a chromatic scale or to use the key.
You can toggle the two by pressing the third pad again.
It will toggle between the two states.

While *In Key*, you can ascend the scale using the first three columns.
While in *Chromatic*, you can ascend the scale/sequence using the first five columns.
It's a bit weird.
