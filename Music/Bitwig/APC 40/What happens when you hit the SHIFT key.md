The grid will change colors.

## Top row
The first three green buttons **add tracks** in this order:
- Instrument
- Audio
- Effect

Then there are two orange buttons.
They **open the browser** so you can insert devices *before or after* the current focused device.
*Note:* you can use either or for a fresh track; there's no difference.

Finally there are two red buttons: **undo and redo**.
