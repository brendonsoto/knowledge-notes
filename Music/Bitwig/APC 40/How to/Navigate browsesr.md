When opening the browser (see [[Music/Bitwig/APC 40/What happens when you hit the SHIFT key]]) the top right eight knobs end up controlling the **active option in the individual panes**.
That sounds a bit confusing.

Imagine a 4x2 grid.
Now imagine each cell is like a menu of options.
The 4x2 layout of knobs in the *Track Control* area of the APC controls the 4x2 menu options on the screen.

Alternatively you can use the *Bank Select* buttons.

Whatever you end up at will *load automatically*.

To *exit the browser* just use the same button combo to enter it (`shift + <orange-button-on-top-row>`)`.
