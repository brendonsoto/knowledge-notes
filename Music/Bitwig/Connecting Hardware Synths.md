- Create an **Instrument track**
- In the *Browser - Devices* pane, look for **HW Instrument** and double click it
- Set the *MIDI Output* to the device you want
- Set the *Channel* to the MIDI channel the device is listening on
- Set the *Return* to the input of the synth in your audio interface
- If your synth supports turning off the keyboard, like the Monologue, it may be worthwhile to do so to avoid *double triggering MIDI n*
