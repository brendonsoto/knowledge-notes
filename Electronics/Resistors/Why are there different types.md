# Why are there different types of resistors?

Asked while exploring [[Electronics/moritz_klein_and_erica_synths_diy/VCO#Why are there different types of resistors|mki x eks.EDU VCO]] DIY kit.

## Differences in when to use one over the other
Different resistors are used for different contexts/problems.
Here are a few examples for types of resistors and when they would be most appropriate:
- Precision (precision metal film) - great accuracy, limited operating temperatures
- Power (power wire wound) - great for dissipating heat, but at the expense of not being as precise
- General purpose (carbon film) - self explanatory

For instance, precision resistors would be very useful in making an accurate oscillator, although general purpose resistors would probably do the job fine too.

## Differences in Tolerances
- Carbon composition ~= 5-20%
- Carbon-film ~= 1-5%
- Metal-film ~= 1%
- Precision metal-film ~= 0.1%
