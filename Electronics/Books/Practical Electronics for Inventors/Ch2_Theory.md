## 2.2 Current
Current **changes w/ time**
Current represents the amount of electrical charge in motion over a set amount of time.

### Unit
**Ampere**
 - Also expressed as: Coulombs per second
 - Ampere is more common
 - Ampere is shortened to *amp*
 - Named after Andre-Marie Ampere

### Electron flow
- electrons move from negative to positive
- discovery credited to Joseph Thomson

This is how we've observed electrons to actually move since positive charges aren't free to move in a solid.
    - Electron flow is more complicated in reality but using the simple model seems fine.

### Conventional flow
- electrons move from positive to negative
- discovery credited to Ben Franklin

This format is still used since the math is easier (don't have to deal with negatives).
Regarding negatives, that's also a bit complicated since measurements of electricity deals with things relative to other things (ex: current )

### 2.2 Questions
What is an ion again?

I don't know how to word this, but I don't understand t he equation after 2.2.b

I wonder how electron flow was observed/proven?
