Some useful notes on breadboards...

- insert pins/wires directly straight down
- be aware of the size of leads you plug into the board
    - forcing a larger plug in may interfere with the springs within the breadboard
- adjacent rows may have high capacitance
    - this is useful if part of the circuit you're working on can change within a few picoFarads, so it's not a terrible problem, but I guess still good to know
- don't use high currents with breadboards
- sometimes there isn't a ground or backing plane to the breadboard
    - this can make it easier for components to short or form capacitance with whatever's underneath the board
