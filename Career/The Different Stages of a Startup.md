## Glossary

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The simplest version of a product that can be sold on the market.

[Atlassain](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/minimum-viable-product) has a nice simple definition:
> the minimum viable product, or MVP, is the simplest version of a product that you need to build to sell it to a market.

### Product market fit
Product market fit describes the scenario where people are buying, using, and telling others about the product at a frequency that sustains the product's profitability. ([Source - ProductPlan](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-market-fit/))

[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/product-market-fit/) has another nice way of putting it:
> It means that there’s [market demand](https://mailchimp.com/resources/research-market-demand/) for what you’re selling, and people are willing to pay for it because it’s better than the alternatives.


## Lifecycle of a startup according to YCombinator

Different places have different ways of describing a startup's life cycle. Here's my brief summary:
- Seed: The beginning stages of a product: initial market research, moving towards a MVP, assembling the core team.
- Early Stage: Getting a better idea of the core product and finding where it fits in the market.
- Growth Stage: There's a core/steady user base and it's time to scale the product and user base.
- Expansion / Late Stage: Trying out new ideas to expand territory in the market / Getting ready for acquisition.

### Zooming in with Venturz's stages to a startup

From [Venturz](https://venturz.co/academy/startup-stages):

- Pre-seed: The start of the idea, performing market research, initial team.
- Seed: Product development, testing the product in the market, early funding.
- Early Stage: Refining the product, early, and potentially growing, user base, seems promising.
- Growth Stage: Scaling the product, wider market testing, has consistent user base.
- Expansion Stage: Trying new ideas and new markets, scaling by introducing new products.
- Exit Phase: Acquisition, Merger, IPO

### YCombinator's Stages

From  [YCombinator - Stages of startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/Ek-stages-of-startups).

#### Seed

- This is the earliest stage.
- Employee count is very low (< 10 employees).
- Funding is usually in single digit millions (1-5, least at YCombinator (YC))
- Salary may not be as high but equity is there.
- May still be iterating on what their main product is and identifying their key customer base.

#### Series A

- Second stage.
- May start hiring more critical roles, like engineering & sales/marketing.
- Funding depends on the industry but can range from single-digit to low multi-digit millions (5-20, at YC)
- Have a working product, but may not have found ideal customer base yet.

#### Growth (Series B/C)

- Have product market fit.
- The focus at this point is on expanding the product's user base and scaling the product.
- Funding: 10-100 mil
- More roles start to emerge to help scale out the product.

#### Scale (Series D and onwards)

- Basically "big tech" at this point.
- They have product market fit.
- 100+ employees.
- Closest to IPO.
