Big picture idea:
Building out a blogging app, front to back.

React client app -> Gateway apollo server -> three different schemas/services

Auth0 as auth

MongoDB as DB

Cloudinary as static files provider

Github API for additional user data

Redis as message queue + optimization layer to GraphQL
