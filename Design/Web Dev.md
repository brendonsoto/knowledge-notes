- Step 1: User Flow
    - Mapping out how a user can accomplish a task using your site/app/tool from start to finish.
- Step 2: Wireframing
    - Creating stub pages that realizes one or more parts of your user flow.
    - This is where UI/UX research and best practices come into play.
    - Aim for simplicity! Simple, accessible, and in your face!
    - Don't be afraid to look at other sites for inspiration and determining what works and what doesn't.
- Step 3: Design System
    - This is where you start visualizing the different components your website/app/tool will need.
    - This encompasses colors, components, fonts, etc.
    - *a e s t h e t i c*
- Step 4: Actual Designing
    - Putting together your elements to create pages.
    - This involves prototyping, testing, iterating, and refining.
    - Try keeping principles in mind.
    - Using real copy (as opposed to lorem ipsum)
        - This is helps make the designs feel more real and give a better idea of what the final product will look like.
- Bonus: Illustrations
    - Pictures r purdy

### Principles

- Visual Hierarchy
    - This is establish the order of importance amongst elements.
        - I like this a lot.
- Contrast
    - This is to help certain elements stand out.
    - I feel like this helps guide users subconsciously towards a goal.
    - This also is to help with accessibility.
- Balance
    - This involves the spacing, alignment, and moderation of elements.
- Consistency
    - You want things to be consistent to avoid confusion.
- Keeping things simple
    - Make the flow straightforward. (Don't Make Me Think!)
- Feedback
    - This is to keep people engaged and helps communicate their actions have been acknowledged.
