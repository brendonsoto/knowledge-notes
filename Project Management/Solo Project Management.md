There's no ordering to this.

### Developing Solo

2024-03-17
[Medium Post](https://medium.com/swlh/developing-solo-dc075fa3127e)

tl;dr - KISS (Keep It Simple Silly!), avoid verbosity

Summarizing:
- make sure you enjoy the environment you're working in
    - this was in the context of coding, but I'm sure the same applies physically too
- automate build, release, and deployment pipelines to save you time
- DON'T commit passwords/tokens/sensitive info!!
- don't over-engineer
- don't trust your memory, document (lol it me)
- "Don't use willpower too much, make better easier"
- dockerize
- certain patterns that may be a pain when working in a team can be a lot easier working solo (e.g. micro-services)

### How to Develop Alone (without Making an Enormous Mess)

[Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/how-develop-alone/)

- keep a list of the "weird stuff" (not ideal code) in your app
    - goes hand-in-hand with "don't trust your memory" from [Developing Solo](Solo%20Project%20Management.md#Developing%20Solo)
    - easy to find things to refactor
    - helpful if bringing others on board
