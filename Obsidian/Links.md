# Obsidian Links
## Syntax
I like the wiki format (the `<>` marks are to act as placeholders )
`[[<page>#<heading?>|<display-text?>]]`

`heading` and `display-text` are optional

Here's a real example to [[Obsidian/Links#Syntax|this very section]]!

## Notes
- Use `tab` for auto-complete / switch between page/header
  - (Right now, use the arrow keys to nav to different suggestions)
  - Example, after entering the double brackets:
  - Press `Obs` (Obisidian pages will probably show)
  - Press `tab` to insert the text of the top result
  - Press `#` to look for headings
  - Press `tab` to insert the text of the top result
  - Press `|` to enter in you text
