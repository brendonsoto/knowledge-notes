# Zettlekasten Example 1
[source](https://iampax.medium.com/zettelkasten-method-with-obsidian-how-to-take-smart-notes-with-examples-cdaf348febbd)

The idea is:
- use full sentences for file names
- use tags to communicate the status of a note (i.e. my to-do tag)
- use links as "categories" (or tags)

Example metadata block at top:
```
----
title:
author:
type:
topics:
```

I have to admit, `type` does not really make sense here.
