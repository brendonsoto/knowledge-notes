- check-in -- weekly/ad-hoc
- development -- based on current pace

Liz has been leading people since they're 22!

## Regarding performance:
- communication lacking between manager and employee that often only comes up in reviews
- this results in a surprise to the employee because they think they're doing fine

## Essentials to a solid 1:1:

- prepare
- use a repeatable template
- talk data and tie to objectives
- make it a two-way conversation -> upward feedback!
- do not shy away from tough messages

By having a template, people will know what to expect.
