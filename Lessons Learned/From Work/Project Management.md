## From Chris/Picard
### From IMS
- Build towards **milestones**
    - Even if it's something like "creating components to build rest of the project"
    - List out what can be available for others to see and/or interact with
    - This gives people a *checkpoint*, something to indicate *this is done*
- Know where you are
    - You can't know where you are going if you don't know where you currently are
- Know what the checkpoints look like

## From Todd
### From IMS Check-in/Review
- Focus on *Risk Management* and lowering that
    - The level of perceived risk can be a good indicator for how a project will come together.
- Make sure everyone knows what the *end goal* is
- Getting people to *align and agree* on what will push the project forward at a certain point of time is crucial
- Get to *E2E* sooner than later
    - Knowing about individual pieces is fine but the tricky part is knowing about putting them together
    - Can think of the rest of the work/iterations as building on top of a skeleton
- Have regular *retros*
- Talk everyday
    - What makes a good standup? #to-do link
- Don't hesitate to ask for help from people higher up
    - Decisions should be pushed not only down but back up if help is needed (i.e. too busy, etc.)
