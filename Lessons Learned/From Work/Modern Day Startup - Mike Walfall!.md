## Takeaways
- Big companies exhibit a combination of being data driven with being customer focused
    - Big companies don't do just one thing
        - For example, Google is search *and* etc...
    - Being customer focused means finding out what the customer values *faster* than others
- **Disruption** = a transition in how things are done caused by the introduction of new technology that improves upon older/current methodologies
- The biggest *barrier to change* is *culture*.
- The **OKR** model is a tool for setting milestones
    - It drives your actions
    - You can even use them as personal milestones
    - You will be wrong, but that's *ok*. Just re-adjust and continue.
    - *Must be measurable*
- Disrupt <- Rapid Innovation <- Rapid Experimentation <- Scientific method <- Know where you are
