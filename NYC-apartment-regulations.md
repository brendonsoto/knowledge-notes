Some context for this document:
This was started January 2024. Our landlord contacted us about renewing our lease which ends in April. The price was going to go up by $900, 25% of what we were paying. I was trying to research about renting in NYC to see if could make a convincing argument for negotiating. I figured to document what I found here in case this nonsense happens again (hopefully not).

## How to find out if your apartment is rent stabilized (and past rent prices)

Use [this form](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask). In the "Reason" dropdown there's an option called "Am I Rent Stabilized". Once submitted, you'll receive a letter from NY's Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). The letter will include the pricing of of the unit you're living in on a yearly basis. There are letter codes to indicate the unit's status, like RS for Rent Stabilized or RC for Rent Controlled. You want to look for these codes in the row for the year you're renting in. If you see "\*EXEMPT APARTMENT - REG NOT REQUIRED\*" that means the apartment is not rent stabilized or controlled. :(

## Is there a legal limit to how much a landlord can raise rent?

Unfortunately, no. Not if the apartment is _not_ rent stabilized or rent controlled. Landlords can raise it as much as they want. They'll just have to give you notice more ahead of time the longer you've been at the apartment.

> - 90 days notice if you have lived in your apartment two years or more.
> - 60 days notice if you have lived in your apartment for more than one year.
> - 30 days notice if you have lived in your apartment for less than one year.
