I used to manage my dotfiles with scripts that I wrote.
The script wasn't perfect and, more times than not, would not work.
I don't work with scripting on a day to day basis.

I have a lot of dotfiles.
I used to manage my dotfiles with shell scripts that I wrote.
The scripts weren't perfect and, more times than not, would not work.
I'm no shell scripting expert and I don't work with shell scripts often enough to feel confident in making a not-hacky solution.
I found out about dotfiles managers and the idea of using a third-party tool that was managed by people who know more about this domain than I do seemed like the logical thing to do.

I primarily work on a macOS machine but also have my linux (Solus) laptop.
Additionally I have a machine dedicated just for music but that I want to have some of my dotfiles on so I can take notes about music stuff and save them with git.

Thus, my **goal** is to have a tool that can setup the tools and configuration files for them on multiple machines with different paths.
