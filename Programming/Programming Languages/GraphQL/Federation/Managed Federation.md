This is another way of saying "Using Apollo Studio to manage your GraphQL API".

- [Install rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/)
- [Authenticate rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/configuring/)
- Open Apollo Studio
- Navigate to the graph you want to add your subgraph too

You'll need:
- a name that's currently not used in the graph
- the URL for your service
- graphql file for the subgraph to add *or* the service to be running
