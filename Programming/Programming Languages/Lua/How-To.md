## Why was Lua made?

Apparently to have an embedded scripting language for C/C++ programs
#to-do

## Install

#to-do
Lua requires a stand-alone interpreter.
One of which is [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/running.html).
It may be *already installed* if using Linux or macOS.

**NOTE:** From here on out, `luajit` will be assumed as the interpreter.

## REPL

`$ luajit`

## Syntax
