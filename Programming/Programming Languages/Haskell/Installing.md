It seems like there's a bit of [contention in the community](https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/issues/191) between whether to use [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#) or [installing Stack to install GHC](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) or [installing GHC directly](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html). For my relearning purposes, I decided to go with GHCup.

When I first started learning Haskell (around 2018-2019) I was going by what was recommended in [Haskell Programming from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/) which recommended Stack.
