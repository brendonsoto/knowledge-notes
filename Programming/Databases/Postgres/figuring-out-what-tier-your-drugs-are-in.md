## Context

At Alloy, 2023, Open enrollment for the new year. Was trying to figure out what tiers my drugs were in. At the time the company provided insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield (which is owned by Anthem).

## How to find what tier your drugs are in

This is subject to change but I figured having some guide could be useful as a baseline for figuring out other insurance providers' tier lists.

Each state has its own tier list. For Anthem, there was this blurb:

> View drug list information for plans in California, New York, or Connecticut.

The three states had hyperlinks. The text was the same size as the rest of the document. I did not discover these links at first because my attention was drawn to the three big buttons labeled: "Click here to access your drug list", "Online Pharmacy Tools Video", and "See our latest drug list changes".

I hate this system.
