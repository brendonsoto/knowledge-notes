A *link table*, also known as a *bridge table*, is a table that associates data from one table to data in a different table.

Use this when you have a **many-to-many** relationship.

Kudos to this [StackExchange post](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119479/what-advantages-do-we-have-when-creating-a-separate-mapping-table-for-two-relati) where I learned of the terminology.
