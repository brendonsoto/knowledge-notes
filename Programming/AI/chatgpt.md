# ChatGPT

## What is it?


ChatGPT is a program that can autonomously interact with someone in a
conversational way. It does this using AI.

Taking the long way to answer this...

From the [ChatGPT website](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/):

> We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.

What's a *model*?
I guess it refers to an AI model looking at Open AI's [research
page](https://openai.com/research/) (Open AI is the company that created
ChatGPT).

IBM explains a model as:
> An AI model is a program that has been trained on a set of data to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention. Artificial intelligence models apply different algorithms to relevant data inputs to achieve the tasks, or output, they've been programmed for.

## What data has ChatGPT been trained on?

ChatGPT uses a mixture of data publicly available online, data from third party
vendors, and data from human "trainers" and researchers. (It feels weird
specifying "human" explicitly as well as the word "trainer")

(Aside, wow, the article in the source does a better job of explaining ChatGPT
than its own home page)
