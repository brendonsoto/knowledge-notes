Just had a thought.
I like to organize my notes into a tree style
But when I get an idea I want to just jot it down immediately.
I also know I don't want to re-organize after I write.
Hence why tags seem nice.
I also don't like looking at a large list of files because that's just stressful.

Or perhaps, I can switch how I do this (write notes) to be more zettlekasten like with just dates.
That'll render the graph view useless though.
