This builds upon content websites that feature breadcrumbs.

Imagine a documentation website where as you click on links the title of the new page is added as a breadcrumb _continuously_. The exception would be using the _back_ navigation functionality, whether through the app or through the browser.

Now mix this with a tiling window manager. When you click a link, the page splits in half and the new page is shown to the right. This is like **Xanadu**, the OG hyperlinking browser.
