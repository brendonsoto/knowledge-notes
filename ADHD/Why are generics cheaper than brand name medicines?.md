From [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/frequently-asked-questions-popular-topics/generic-drugs-questions-answers#q4):
> Generic drugs tend to cost less than their brand-name counterparts because generic drug applicants do not have to repeat animal and clinical (human) studies that were required of the brand-name medicines to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. This abbreviated pathway is why the application is called an â€œ_abbreviated_ new drug application.
