## Take aways
- ADHD is largely linked to genetics and neurological changes (caused by things like physical damage (think hitting head real hard as a kid) or environmental/chemical happenings like lead paint)
- We don't know the extent of misdiagnosing because there is no nationwide nor worldwide database
    - If a doctor is going through a diagnostic with a person and they're just near the threshold, they'll probably give the person the diagnosis so they can begin to get help on the impairment.

## Notes
Questions exploring:
- Is ADHD a myth?
- Are we misdiagnosing or over-diagnosing ADHD?

Genetics seem to be a large part of how ADHD forms.
There's some research that environmental factors (stress, global state of world) may play a role but it seems like those factors are from things like blunt force trauma or toxic chemicals.

There are two genes, DRD4 and DAT1 (the latter sounds like a joke lol dat one!), that have been associated with ADHD. These genes occur in copies sitting side-by-side. ADHD people have more than non-ADHD people.
While that's interesting, there's not much we can do about genes, right?

These genes impact matters of the brain like sending and/or receiving neurotransmitters related to ADHD or how other happenings in the brain may influence signals related to dopamine. (One example talked: "Or perhaps it has too many alpha-2 ports along
its axon or cell trunk that allow too much “noise” to degrade the
nerve signal traveling along that axon.")

Another way genetics may play a role is through gene mutation. Apparently lots of things in the environment can cause it (think of sun's rays).
