From [consumer reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2012/05/why-do-my-pills-look-different-each-time-i-fill-the-same-prescription/index.htm):
> Due to certain patent laws that govern brand-name medications, generic drug manufacturers are not allowed to copy how a brand-name pill looks in terms of its shape, its color and its size. Additionally, generic drug manufacturers can also take it a step further by producing generic pills that look different from another manufacturer's generics pills.

A neat tool found from them: [Pill Identifier](https://www.drugs.com/pill_identification.html)
**NOTE:** Be skeptical. Consumer Reports was known to advise parents against either brand or generic medication because they thought kids were getting hooked.
