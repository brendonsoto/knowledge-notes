# How to Get Projects Done, On Time, Without Your Life Falling Apart in the Process
[source - HowToADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsP7COz-XFQ)

> If you want to do more, do less

- learn how to evaluate what values are worthwhile to take on
  - uses analogy of finances and making sure you can pay for something and judging whether something is worth it

Questions to ask when evaluating:
- What am I getting myself into?
  - know what the commitment is, expectations
- Why do I want it?
  - what value, intrinsic/extrinsic motivation
- How much will it cost?
  - time is the cost
  - can't really predict unless:
    - you've done it before
    - you break the goal down backwards
      - double/triple the time you think will take for it
- How will I pay for it?
  - maybe think of schedule as a time-budget?

Use the questions to determine if what you're getting *out* of a project is worth what you'll be putting *into* it
