# How to Get Stuff Done When You Have ADHD
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLkOZhROvA4)

- pre-frontal cortex
  - part of brain for focusing on stuff
  - works differently for people w/ ADHD
    - if the activity doesn't interest us, trying to focus will disengage us
- hyper-focusing is a problem
  - this is why we usually wait till the last minute

Ended with the pomodoro technique
I know that's not really for me, after using it for quite some time (remember the NHL days?)
