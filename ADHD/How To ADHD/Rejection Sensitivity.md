# Rejection Sensitivity
[Source - HowToADHD: How to Deal with Rejection Sensitivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM3azhiOy5E)

## Difference between Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) vs Rejection Sensitivity
### RSD
- created by Dr. William Dodson
- an indescribable pain caused by perceiving loss of approval, love, or respect
- there is medication for it, but most psychiatrists may not have heard of it
- it's not in the DSM V
  - hasn't been researched yet

### Rejection Sensitivity
- > the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection
  - sounds like almost looking or priming the brain for failure from anxiety
- not exclusive to ADHD
  - also often used in cases of anxiety, borderline personality disorder, depression, body dysmorphic disorder
  - common to ADHD since we have bad cases of regulating emotions and history of rejection
- from Caroline Maguire (writer of "Why No One will Play with Me?")
  - what actually happens doesn't matter
    - what does is how intensely you feel about it
  - our bodies more easily enter fight/flight/freeze
  - we turn into people pleasers
    - afraid of asking for things or advocating for ourselves

#### Four R's
Also from Caroline

##### Recognize where you're at emotionally
Higher the emotions you're feeling, the more you'll struggle with cognitive abilities

Check in w/ your body
  - examples: fists clenched, teeth clenched, stomach tight, fighting tears, face feeling flushed
Once you know where you're at, respond with a strategy that makes sense for where you are at

HowToADHD acknowledged strategies and emotions are different for everyone so they tried to make the following general categories:
- green
  - normal / feeling good
  - more apt to try things that may end in rejection
  - alternatively, self-care to help you feel good so you're better prepped for things that may bring on feelings of imminent rejection
  - maybe try to resolve convos that didn't go too well
- yellow
  - highten emotions, but still somewhat able to think rationally
  - do tasks that can help de-escalate emotions a bit
    - examples: asking for clarification, count to 3 before speaking, focus on breathing, go for a walk, tea
- red
  - high emotions, fight/flight/freeze
  - since cognitive ability is low, responses to this mode need to be practiced/scripted
  - "When we're in the red, we're not ready for human consumption" - Caroline
  - focus on disengaging, putting the current thing on hold, then try to bring yourself to a more stable place, and then try continuing

##### Reflect & Reframe
- the first thoughts we have about situations are usually not correct since cognitive distortion
- stuff we perceive as rejection is may be a conflict of needs
- "Not everything that *feels* like rejection *is* rejection"
- self-validation
