"Motivation Deficit Disorder"

# How To ADHD's "How to NOT NEED as Much Motivation to do the Thing" video

Shorten the "chasm" between the starting point and goal
"The less we have to rely on motivation the better"

- Break into smaller chunks
  - I always struggle with this
    - #to-do think about how to break more abstract stuff
    - don't be afriad to break things out into even smaller things, even if it's like "step 1: get up, step 2: walk to desk, step 3: open laptop, etc."
    - "how small the tasks are depends on where you're at for the day"
      - Like w/ running/exercise!
- Reduce "barriers" to doing the task
  - usually something that's lengthy, repetitive, boring, etc.
  - physical, organizational, sensory
  - #to-do view the video she linked to on this vid related to barriers
- Make the task easier
  - Think about how much of the task stems from pressure you're putting on yourself vs the task itself
  - "Identify what you're doing and not doing to avoid scope creep"
  - There's a "translation" step people, especially neurodivergent people, do of hearing "do x" and somehow turning that into "do x, y, and z"
- Get support
  - Doing something w/ someone?
  - TaskRabbit / InstaCart
- Ride the wave
  - Don't be afraid to go with your brain's flow
