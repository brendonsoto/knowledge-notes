# How to Give Your Brain the Stimulation It Needs
[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6WCkTwW6xg)

Gave the idea of being on social-media or something for way longer than planned for
We do this because we're looking for sources of dopamine to stimulate ourselves

It's like filling a bucket that has a hole in it

To really fill this, there are a lot of steps into it

Separate *planning* from *choosing*
Separate executive-functions

we're looking for something to stimulate us in the moment

## "DopaMenu"
Looks like our "Free Dopamine" jar

### Step 1: Design "Menu"
- Desserts
  - label go-tos for when your bored and don't feel great
- Entrees
  - list things that make you feel good
- Appetizers
  - things for quick dopamine bursts
- Sides
  - How to make things more engaging
- Specials
  - Things for once in a while
  
### Step 2: Omit
- omit any items that aren't available at the moment

### Step 3: Pick "Ingredients"
- setup stuff so getting into the Appetizers/Good stuff on the menu is

Decrease the number of steps towards doing the good things
Opposite for bad things, make it harder

### Step 4: Advertise
Make it seem more engaging/enticing by adding stuff that will make you look at it or more interested in it
- blurbs
- pictures
- etc.

Guest mentioned you "feel" the difference physically as a warning signal
