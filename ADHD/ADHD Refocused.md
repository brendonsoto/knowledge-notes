### Resonant Quotes
(Kindle: Location 136):
> More than "What is ADHD," we have to ask, "What's my relationship to it? To what extent does it define who I am?"


### Questions
- What is this Scribe thing discussed on the first page?

## Ch1 - My Story
Dr Levin... Levin sounds familiar...

### Quotes
(Kindle: Location 297)
> I was also referred to a behavioral specialist, who helped me develop time- and task-management techniques over the course of that semester. I started mapping out my assignments and looking at due dates, forcing myself to start a paper a week in advance rather than the night before.

HOW?!?!!?

## Ch2 - Adult ADHD
Hallowell... that sounds familiar too...
He wrote a book on the subject (Kindle: Location 395)

### Questions
(Kindel: location 356)
Wasn't the idea of ADHD being divided into inattentive, hyperactive, or both debunked?

## Ch3 - Clinical ADHD Causes 
### To look up
- GABA
- acetylcholine


### Questions
(Kindle: Location 530):
> This affects my ability to plan. People are driven by what is stimulating them...

If stimulation is needed to plan effectively, how does the ADHD person supposed to overcome that? Wouldn't trying to find a spin on the task to make it sound stimulating require mental energy/effort as well?
Seems like medication is the answer, from the same page.
