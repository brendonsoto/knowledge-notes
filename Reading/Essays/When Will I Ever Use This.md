are things. Our lives are governed a great deal by our thoughts.” (- S.W. Kimball)

## Takeaway
"You can't connect the dots forwards, only backwards"

Our experiences and observations are shaped by what we know.
Learning expands our possible perspectives by giving us more lenses to analyze our experiences with.
While we cannot predict the future, we can use the knowledge we accumulate to see the world differently.
This can help us with day to day tasks (doctor example), being creative (Steve Jobs example), and reflection (Utah Jazz owner + coach in the two-on-one example).
