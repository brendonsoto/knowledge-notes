This article has left an impression on me.

I'm still processing.
I share similar opinions as the author in the beginning; preferring long verbose code over short and concise but slightly cryptic.
It was interesting to see the author's shift in perspective.
It has me questioning my own.

I never thought about having more code bunched together as a means of crafting a broader view of functionality.
I guess, like all things, it depends on the context.
I can't imagine this style being appropriate in all contexts.
But then again, maybe I can't imagine it because I've never seen anything like it.
Maybe it is out there.
Or maybe it's something to be developed.
I think that's worthwhile to strive for.

Additionally, this motivates me to seek to read other's code more to try to broaden my horizons, kind of like how I would watch or listen to other musicians/guitarists to get an idea of their techniques.
