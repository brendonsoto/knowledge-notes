## Introduction
### General
Interesting trying to accompljsh a general solution/approach that includes the human "feel for a situation"

> like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.

The example with the architct seems like just designing software for architecture.

### B. Objective of the study

## Conceptual Framework
### A. General
Mentions information we take in is limited by our perception (our senses).
Seems like an indirect description of  psychology.

*Augmentation means* - ways to extend our capabilities 
- **artifacts** - physical objects for manipulation 
- **language**
- **methodology** - strategies for problem solving
- **training** - exposure to above three means in order to make the individual effective

What's more important is acknowledging learning happens**step by step**.

*Process hierarchies* - breaking a large complex task down into smaller ones using the augmentation means

Problem solving strategies start with the familiar, not a unique approach every time.

> We find three general categories of process capabilities within a typical individual's repertoire. There are those that are executed completely within the human integument, which we call explicit-human process capabilities; there are those possessed by artifacts for executing processes without human intervention, which we call explicit-artifact process capabilities; and there are what we call the composite process capabilities, which are derived from hierarchies containing both of the other kinds.

This was a bit confusing.
Seems like the three categories of processes are:
- what's possible without the aid of artifacts
- processes carried out by artifacts without human intervention (like a program?)
- combo

Focus on approaching this problem of augmenting human intellect as a systems problem.
Explore the reorganizing methods, new and old.

### B. The basic perspective

https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#2b3
Never think there's a single, let alone complete, approach for analyzing a system 

### C. DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE H-LAM/T SYSTEM

The organization of information and processes is what enables us to solve complex problems and innovate

### Intelligence Amplification
Didnt write down anything.

### 3. Two-Domain System
I think the second paragraph gives a better idea to the above confusing categorization of processes.
Explicit human process seems to be anything, *anything*, stemming from just the human, like thought or moving a finger or engaging in senses.
The explicit-artifact bit seems like the capabilities of the object itself, like a typewriter printing a character to paper.

Additionally, it seems interesting that the interaction between human and machine is described as a transfer of energy.

### 4. Concepts, Symbols, and a Hypothesis

Interesting...

> Korzybski[4] and Whorf[5] (among others) have argued that the language we use affects our thinking to a considerable extent. They say that a lack of words for some types of concepts makes it hard to express those concepts, and thus decreases the likelihood that we will learn much about them. If this is so, then once a language has begun to grow and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the language also affects the evolution of the new concepts to be expressed in that language.

> The Whorfian hypothesis states that "the world view of a culture is limited by the structure of the language which that culture uses."

### 5. Capability Repertoire Hierarchy
Capabilities with the potential to significantly facilitate solving complex problems are formed by combining current capabilities/structures.
We are developing a sense of what combinations are useful for certain contexts so the authors avoid saying "purposeful" combinations.
At the time of writing, 5 capability types/structures were described:

Mental structuring
Any internal processes for reasoning within the mind, conscious or not.
Psychology uses the term *cognitive structure* to describe this idea.
The reason the authors did not also use this term was because they felt there was not enough info to confidently say the term described what they were trying to describe.

I think I'm going to abandon reading the piece now. The information here is extremely wordy to the point where I have to focus really hard on transforming the language into simple terms. This is not really because of a heavy use of jargon, but more because of expressing ideas verbosely. The extra words do not add to the idea. I honestly feel it detracts  from the idea if anything. 

I feel that if I were to pursue making tools to augment our capabilities that a mixture of trial and error alongside communicating with my target audience would be more helpful. I know the idea here is to make tools for the general public. I can't help but think making tools for myself and close ones , in other words more specific tools, would produce results quicker and more efficiently than trying to make a general product. I believe the specific could be tweaked to form the general. 

Any who, I guess I'm writing this for my future self, for if i were to revisit this and wonder why I never finished it. Who knows, maybe the timing is just not right.
