# How to easily learn difficult things

* Context broadening
  * connecting the topic to something that interests you or evokes strong imagery
    * you can also google for a story about the idea that interests you
  * this is primarily for if you're not already curious about the topic
  * this is to build curiosity and emotional investment

* Dopamine priming
  * build up hype/emotional investment into the topic so you want to learn more about the topic.

* Singular deep dive
  * zoom into a specific aspect of the idea/problem and use curiosity/questions to zoom out
  * this is to follow your curiosity/dopamine to strengthen your involvement in the topic
  * Luhmann, Baecker, Stanitzek -- idea of once you're interest drops, don't push through, leave it be and return to it when you're curious again. Eventually, you may come back to this idea another day once it becomes relevant in the moment.
